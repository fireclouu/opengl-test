# OpenGL Test
Learning basic stuffs into Graphics programming via OpenGL API, and to utilize GPU usages for performance and multiplaform support.

## Motivation
For better support of my future application's GUI capable of rendering on most devices that supports OpenGL specifications, targets multi-platform support with minimal configurations on platform-specific options.

## Milestones
- [x] Introduction to Graphics Programming
- [x] OpenGL as Graphics API
- [x] Communication with GPU
- [ ] Basic Shaders (Vertex and Fragment Shaders)
- [ ] OpenGL Primitives and Vertex Draws
