# OpenGL Test
Learning Graphics Render Programming via OpenGL API, to utilize GPU hardware for cross-device support.

## Motivation
For future development integration which requires custom or uniform UI across devices that understands OpenGL API.

## How to run or test?
Make sure your device supports graphical interface and OpenGL 3.3 installed. Install required libraries:
`libglfw3 libglfw3-dev`

and supported packages. This project also uses GLAD library which is already integrated.

## Milestones
